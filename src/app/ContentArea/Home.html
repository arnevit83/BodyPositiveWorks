      <p>
          We are way too hard on ourselves. 
 
          When you walk through our doors, you‘ll discover a “happy place” – filled with positive energy, laughter, and fun! 
           
          Body Positive Works is all about feeling good about yourself and knowing you are valued for exactly who you are.
           
          NO body shaming, food shaming, or exercise shaming allowed. In fact, no shaming, period!
           
          For every body
           
          We began with a simple idea: To create a place where people can build community, receive support, and speak openly about their lives. 
           
          BoPo Works is truly for everybody. We tailor our services to the needs of each individual, and invite people of all ages, cultures, sexes, and gender identities to join us in honoring the inner qualities that make each and every one of us unique.
           
          All under one roof
           
          We’ve brought everything together under one roof so that we can offer an integrated optimal health and wellbeing service based around the individual’s needs – whether that’s a yoga class, nutrition, or psychotherapy.
           
          Our expertise
           
          Our areas of expertise are eating disorders, negative body image, substance addiction, anxiety and depression. 
           
          We are proud to be home to many of Bergen County’s expert practitioners – psychotherapists, nutritionists, anxiety therapists, art therapists, drug and alcohol addiction counselors and chiropractors, alongside holistic modalities including massage, yoga, Pilates, reiki, meditation, and ayurveda. 
           
          Winners of the Bergen Magazine Readers Choice Awards for yoga, we are the integrative health center of choice for Saddle River, Bergen County and Rockland County.
