              <h2>What is Homeopathy?</h2> <br />
              <h4> 
                Homeopathy is an effective and scientific system of healing, recognized by the FDA, which gently stimulates the body’s own ability to heal with the help of remedies derived from nature.  
                <br /><br />Homeopathy sees symptoms as expressions of disharmony within the person and therefore treats the person as a whole, not the disease. So, a good homeopath looks beyond the symptoms of anxiety to diagnose the root cause, which might be an unhealthy emotional problem resulting from a negative life experience like loss or disappointment or a frightening experience. These deep-seated traumas cause energy blockages and mental, emotional and/or physical dis-ease.  
                <br /><br />Homeopathic healing is used by around five million American adults and one million children each year, and today the World Health Organization recognizes it as “the second largest therapeutic system” in the world.

              <h4> 
         
                Homeopathic treatment helps resolve deeply rooted imbalances for the long term, rather than just bringing temporarily relief. The balanced state that the homeopath works towards is the inner state of calm and tranquility and a connectedness to our divine nature that allows us to express ourselves freely and live our higher purpose.

                The Body Positive Works approach was born of the realization that having a variety of holistic services under one roof – and providing a strong sense of community – would support clients in achieving better overall health, recovery, and long-term growth.
 
                <br /><br />All Body Positive Works modalities aim to treat the whole person, and homeopathy is no exception. It is through the integration of these healing modalities that we serve our communities on their paths to health and healing. We believe that, hand in hand with nature, we can create a brighter, healthier future for both ourselves and the planet.

            <h4>
              We offer individual, private homeopathy consultations. In these sessions our homeopath develops a customized program based on the individual needs of the client.
              <br /> <br />
An initial homeopathic consultation usually lasts 1 to 2 hours. Homeopathic practitioners really listen, practicing a skill they are trained to do well! While taking a very comprehensive case history, covering the persons physical, emotional, mental and spiritual makeup, the homeopathic practitioner listens very carefully – striving to understand how the person is experiencing their illness – going way beyond the common and superficial symptoms of the disease. 
<br /> <br />
The starting point is the belief that every person is unique – in homeopathic treatment no two colds are considered the same! So the goal of a consultation is to recognize and understand each person’s unique state of being. This information is then graded in importance by our practitioner, to find a single remedy that will help restore the individual to health and create an experience of wellbeing. 
<br /> <br />
<b>How homeopathy works</b>
<br /> <br />
Homeopathy is based on the principle of Law of Similar or “Like cures like”- a concept that dates back to the Greek Father of Medicine, Hippocrates. The word is derived from the Greek word “homeo”, which means “same/similar”, and “pathos” which means suffering. 
<br /> <br />
So, a homeopathic remedy is used to treat the symptoms that the remedy would actually cause in a healthy person. For example, in healthy individuals, cutting an onion often results in a runny nose and teary eyes. Therefore, the homeopath would use a homeopathic remedy made of onion (Allium Cepa) for an individual who is exhibiting these symptoms, perhaps caused by seasonal allergies or by respiratory discomfort. 
The homeopathic remedies we use have been sourced from nature and then diluted and potentized and, once a remedy reaches a certain dilution, the healing power of the remedies works on a much deeper level. 
<br /> <br />
Our homeopathic remedies are prepared according to the U.S. FDA recognized Homeopathic Pharmacopoeia.

A graduate of the prestigious Academy of Homeopathic Education NYC/World – a rigorous full time classical homeopathic school requiring a minimum of 1000 hours of study, she is passionate about living with intention, spending time in nature, and helping others connect to their highest calling.
                                            <br/><br/>
                                            Mehnaz has lived holistically since childhood. Her granddad - who was a traditional healer - would often use saffron and vinegar to treat headaches and the stories of his talent for organic alchemy, coupled with her dad’s passion for homeopathy, inspired her to look for alternative ways to live. She went on to raise her own kids the same way – educating them with Waldorf inspired activities and nurturing them with alternative medicine. She found that, by living this way, they sailed through childhood injury and illness with ease, growing to be strong and healthy young adults. 
                                            <br/><br/>
                                            Through her experience of raising her kids with alternative and holistic care, and helping friends and neighbors in times of need, she learned that our bodies have a limitless capacity for healing when fully nurtured. She also realized the power of nature to help that healing, especially when we live our lives in such a way that aligns to our own natural disposition.
                                            <br/><br/>
                                            It was these experiences that inspired her to take up a career as a classical homeopath, so that she could pass on the gentle and subtle healing that remedies derived from nature provide, helping many more people towards a healthy, conscious and balanced life.
