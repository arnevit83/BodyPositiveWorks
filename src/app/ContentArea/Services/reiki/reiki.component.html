              <h4> 
                    When people ask us “What is reiki?” we explain that it’s a gentle, light-touch treatment, used to accelerate the body’s natural ability to relax, release stress and heal itself on all levels – physical, mental, emotional & spiritual.
 
                    <br /><br />Reiki healing is completely non-invasive & safe for everyone, including children. It supports the body, mind and spirit in returning to its natural state of balance and wellbeing.
                     
                    <br /><br />In case you think reiki therapy is a bit “out there”, it is actually on the roster of services at numerous hospitals throughout the U.S. and the world.

              <h4> 
         
                    Reiki works hand-in-hand with conventional medicine. It can help reduce anxiety, stress, depression and insomnia, diminish pain, reduce side effects from treatments for various illnesses, release habitual patterns and addictions, accelerate healing and help to maintain a healthy immune system.
                    <br /><br />
                    It can also calm emotions and promote relaxation, self-empowerment, self-awareness and inner peace, as well as enhances your ability to meditate.
                    <br /><br />
                    Reiki, meditation and breath work have been shown to be of immense benefit to caretakers – mothers and fathers, and others caring for family members, doctors, nurses, aides, therapists and anyone who could use support while supporting others.

                    At Body Positive Works we create treatments around the individual; listening to your needs and creating sessions that empower and celebrate you. Reiki treatments are no exception. Your Reiki Master will create a treatment based entirely on your needs.
                    <br /><br />
                    You will be lying down, fully clothed, but you may choose whether the practitioner touches you (lightly) or not at all. If you feel a sensation you’d like to discuss, then do ask. It’s important that you feel relaxed as that, after all, is the point of Reiki.
                    <br /><br />
                    A reiki session can be used individually or in conjunction with other modalities like meditation and breath work. Each modality supports a re-connection of mind, body and spirit. This, in turn, supports a positive change in perspective about your body and your life, empowering you to recognize your strengths and purpose and live fully in the present moment.
                    <br /><br />
                    Used in conjunction with psychotherapy it can help to reduce stress and anxiety and further benefit the therapeutic process.
                    <br /><br />
                    You will receive instruction on how to take these practices home with you and use them in your everyday life.
