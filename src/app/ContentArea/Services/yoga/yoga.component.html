        <h2>What is Yoga?</h2> <br />
        <h4> 
          
            There is a common misunderstanding that yoga is all about fancy poses – standing on one hand or twisting your body into a pretzel. While this may have a place on Instagram, it doesn’t have a place in our studio because it’s not what yoga is to us.
            <br /><br />
            To us yoga is a tool for modern life; a way for everyone - regardless of shape, size or age - to listen to, respect and honor their body. If you can breathe you can do yoga!
            <br /><br />
            It’s also a tool to honor the mind – why let all that negative chatter get in the way of having a great life? Yoga helps us rise above all that chatter, so we can be still. With that stillness it's a lot easier (believe us) to see clearly, choose wisely, and act courageously – to handle any curve balls life might throw your way. 
            <br /><br />
            For us yoga is also about community. If you’d asked the ancient sages what yoga is, they’d tell you the word means “to yoke” – what they were talking about is unity. It’s about unifying our body, breath and mind on the mat, and taking it off the mat to create a deep sense of connection with our fellow human beings, and with our best self.

        <h2>Benefits of Yoga</h2> <br />
        <h4> 
            There are thousands of clinical studies on yoga now and together they prove there to be around 250 health benefits of yoga. At the root of it all is yoga’s effect on the parasympathetic nervous system. Let’s call it the PNS for short.  Basically, the PNS lowers heart rate and blood pressure, which helps us relax.
            <br /><br />
            That’s why the benefits of yoga include relief of any stress related condition – from anxiety and depression to PTSD, substance abuse and eating disorders. Think of it this way… every time you roll out a yoga mat, your nervous system is breathing a huge sigh of relief.
            <br /><br />
            Yoga’s benefits are endless: improved flexibility, balance, sleep, mood, memory, attitudes to food, energy levels, self-esteem, and even helping us cope better with a wide range of health conditions – from migraines to diabetes to dealing with cancer.

        <h4>
          
          Our yoga instructors are there for everyone, and every type of body - empowering and celebrating your path to loving yourself. 

   <br /><br />
            It’s all about connecting with, accepting and celebrating your body, your mind and your spirit. That’s why our yoga classes emphasize listening to your body’s “voice”. In our yoga studio there’s no universal “right” way to do a yoga pose, and no judgment. You can go into a restful pose at any point during yoga class if that’s what your body needs. We teach every yoga student to “stay on their own mats” and not compare themselves with others, or what they “used to” be able to do.
            <br /><br />
            Our studio is mirror free!  Our yoga is accessible to EVERY BODY.

              Guided meditation is simply meditating with the help of a guide. Sit, close your eyes and listen to the sound of the leader's voice.
              <br /><br />  It’s one of the easiest ways to enter into a state of deep relaxation and inner stillness, and it’s one of the most powerful ways to eliminate stress and bring about positive personal changes.

                            Maria’s yoga practice has provided a source of balance and inspiration during phases of change, challenge, and self-study. To her, yoga is an earnest companion for growth that is both physical and mental – both are pathways for an initiation to openness, compassion, and mindfulness. “My primary intention is to help people learn to heal themselves.” In late childhood/early adulthood she was plagued by anxiety, depression, addiction, body image issues, and broken relationships—these all experiences led her to heal and transform mind, body and soul. She experienced it as “alchemy.” Says Maria, “I had a chemical reaction to the first yoga class I took some 16 years ago (2002). So much so that many years later, I changed my career, my mothering, the people I surround myself with, my analyst, my diet, and the way that I saw myself… I did not plan to become a yoga instructor; but it was an organic result of my urge to honor and teach this practice, wherever it takes me.”
                            <br />   <br />
                            From her hometown of River Vale she has been teaching happiness, awareness, and joyful living. Maria has devoted her life to inspiring others to be themselves. Maria has extensive knowledge and education in health and fitness, anatomy and holistic nutrition. However, she believes that inner work is most rewarding. She sees that everyone has the potential to feel contentment and she uses asana as a tool to guide her students towards inner peace. She uses her boundless enthusiasm, and a realistic approach to challenge as a way to connect.
                            <br />   <br />
                            When she is not in the yoga studio, you can usually find her walking her Chesapeake Bay Retriever, riding horses with her daughter or spending time at home with her husband, two cats and three step children.
                             <br />   <br />
                            Maria gives thanks to all her yoga teachers and students. In addition to her 500 RYT- yoga certification which includes Y12SR- Yoga for Addiction and Recovery, Yoga Barre, Yin Yoga Restorative, Yoga Nidra, Ayurveda. She is also certified in group fitness AFFA and is a personal training corrective exercise specialist (NASM, CPR-AED).

                              Faith Kaufman was a lawyer before completely changing her path in life. She left for the opportunity to combine two things that are close to her heart – yoga and children. Faith is a mom of 3 daughters and married to her college sweetheart. Faith is certified to teach kids yoga from Naturally Yoga in Glen Rock, NJ, Karma Kids Yoga in NYC, Kidding Around Yoga in NYC, and Yogi Beans in NYC. Faith has developed kids’ yoga programs at various local schools and gyms and for four years Faith has worked at Ramaquois Day Camp. Faith received her 200-hour RYT teacher certification from Ben Wisch at Flow Yoga in Ho-Ho-Kus, N.J. 
                              <br /> <br />
                            Faith’s goal is to expand opportunities for children to grow and learn yoga in a fun and nurturing environment and is ecstatic to blend her experience teaching children, with her passion for yoga. She creates classes that inspire confidence, relax the body and spark the imagination. Faith believes that yoga can help kids have a calm and balanced mind and body.
                            <br /> <br />
                            Faith’s yoga classes incorporate the use of animated poses, stretches and games to promote strength, flexibility, coordination and balance. She will also practice meditation and guide visualization to teach the kids to focus, relax and develop self-control in a non-competitive environment. Yoga is supposed to be FUN and through stories, games, songs and poses the kids will learn to love yoga!

                            Michelle came to yoga looking for an alternative to high-impact activity due to injury and looking for a way to increase flexibility and strength safely. Living with body image issues her entire life, yoga became a tremendous tool on her road to body acceptance. Yoga provided the tools to allow her to practice in a judgment-free zone and, most importantly, her mat became the safe space she needed to allow the mind-body connection she was missing.
                            <br /> <br /> 
                            Michelle teaches options and customizations to work for every type of body, in the here and now. Her yoga classes combine mindful movement and breath work accessible to all.
