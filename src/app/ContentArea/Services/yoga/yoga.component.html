        <h2>What Is Yoga?</h2> <br /><br />
        <h4> There is a common misunderstanding that yoga is all about fancy poses – standing on one hand or twisting your body into a pretzel. While this may have a place on Instagram, it doesn’t have a place in our studio because it’s not what
          yoga is to us. <br /><br /> To us yoga is a tool for modern life; a way for everyone - regardless of shape, size or age - to listen to, respect and honor their body. If you can breathe you can do yoga! <br /><br /> It’s also a tool to
          honor the mind – why let all that negative chatter get in the way of having a great life? Yoga helps us rise above all that chatter, so we can be still. With that stillness it's a lot easier (believe us) to see clearly, choose wisely, and
          act courageously – to handle any curve balls life might throw your way. <br /><br /> For us yoga is also about community. If you’d asked the ancient sages what yoga is they’d tell you the word means “to yoke” – what they were talking about
          is unity. It’s about unifying our body, breath and mind on the mat, and taking it off the mat to create a deep sense of connection with our fellow human beings, and with our best self. <br /><br />

        <h2>Benefits of Yoga</h2> <br /><br />
        <h4> There are thousands of clinical studies on yoga now and they have proven there to be around 250 health benefits of yoga. At the root of it all is yoga’s effect on the parasympathetic nervous system. Let’s call it the PNS for short.
          Basically, the PNS lowers heart rate and blood pressure, which helps us relax. <br /><br /> That’s why the benefits of yoga include relief of any stress related condition – from anxiety and depression to PTSD and eating disorders. Think of
          it this way… every time you roll out a yoga mat, your nervous system is breathing a huge sigh of relief. <br /><br /> Yoga’s benefits are endless; improved flexibility, balance, sleep, mood, memory, attitudes to food, energy levels,
          self-esteem, and even helping us cope better with a wide range of health conditions – from migraines to diabetes to dealing with cancer. <br /><br />

          your path to loving yourself. There’s no cookie cutter approach; to us it’s really simple – everyone has a different body, so everyone needs to approach asanas differently. <br /><br /> It’s all about connecting with, accepting and
          celebrating your body, your mind and your spirit. That’s why our yoga classes emphasize listening to your body’s “voice”. In our yoga studio there’s no universal “right” way to do a yoga pose, and no judgment. You can go into a restful
          pose at any point during yoga class if that’s what your body needs. We teach every yoga student to “stay on their own mats” and not compare themselves with others, or what they “used to” be able to do. <br /><br /> Our studio is mirror
          free!  Our yoga is accessible to EVERY BODY. <br /><br />

                            Michigan, and an MBA in Marketing from the University of Pennsylvania’s Wharton School, Jen launched a successful career as a marketing professional in Manhattan. She began her yoga practice after her third knee surgery
                            at the age of 39. Originally there for the physical benefits, she soon realized that the philosophy behind the practice was helping her make peace with the negative body image issues she had struggled with since her teen
                            years. <br /><br /> Eager to share yoga’s benefits, Jen decided to train as a yoga teacher and received her 200-hour teacher certification from Ben Wisch at Flow Yoga in Ho-Ho-Kus, N.J., and opened her own studio, Defiant
                            Yoga, with the mission of helping individuals of all ages learn to love and accept themselves exactly as they are. She is proud to expand this mission as co-founder of Body Positive Works, an integrative healing and
                            wellness sanctuary located in Saddle River, NJ. <br /><br /> Jen has taken advanced trainings with Dr. Melody Moore of the Embody Love Movement, Leslie Kaminoff of Yoga Anatomy and Charlotte Stone of the Stone Center for
                            Yoga and Health. She is currently working on her 500 hour certification with Jody Domerstad of Become One Wholeness and so far has completed Neurosculpting®, Yin Yoga Level One, and Functional Anatomy. <br /><br /> Jen
                            was also instrumental in launching Kula for Karma’s Yoga for Eating Disorder Recovery program. She co-wrote the manual and teaches the Yoga for Recovery from Eating Disorders advanced teacher trainings. She is passionate
                            about this work and continues to teach Kula’s Yoga for Eating Disorders weekly at Body Positive Works. <br /><br /> In her yoga classes, Jen’s main priority is to help students hear their bodies’ signals and adjust the
                            practice to their unique needs in a welcoming, non-competitive space. Jen focuses on the purpose of the poses and how they feel rather than how they look. Students are encouraged to look at the language they use towards
                            their bodies (there is no such thing as a “bad” hip!) and to “stay on their own mats” (don’t compare!). Jen knows from personal experience that while embracing one’s body can be a challenging, lifelong journey, a regular
                            yoga practice reminds us that our bodies deserve to be treated with the utmost kindness, love and respect. </div>

                            phases of change, challenge, and self-study. To her, yoga is an earnest companion for growth that is both physical and mental – both are pathways for an initiation to openness, compassion, and mindfulness. “My primary
                            intention is to help people learn to heal themselves.” In late childhood/early adulthood she was plagued by anxiety, depression, addiction, body image issues, and broken relationships—these all experiences led her to heal
                            and transform mind, body and soul. She experienced it as “alchemy,” I had a chemical reaction to the first yoga class I took some 16 years ago (2002). So much so that many years later, I changed my career, my mothering,
                            the people I surround myself with, my analyst, my diet, and the way that I saw myself…. I did not plan to become a yoga instructor; but it was an organic result of my urge to honor and teach this practice wherever it
                            takes me. <br /> <br /> From her hometown of River Vale she has been teaching happiness, awareness, and joyful living. Maria has devoted her life to inspiring others to be themselves. Maria has extensive knowledge and
                            education in health and fitness, anatomy and holistic nutrition, however she believes that inner work is most rewarding. She sees that everyone has the potential to feel contentment and she uses asana as a tool to guide
                            her students towards inner peace. She uses her boundless enthusiasm, and a realistic approach to challenge as a way to connect. <br /> <br /> When she is not in the yoga studio, you can usually find her walking her
                            Chesapeake Bay Retriever, riding horses with her daughter or spending time at home with her husband, two cats and three step children. <br /> <br /> Maria gives thanks to all her yoga teachers and students. In addition to
                            her 500 RYT- yoga certification which includes Y12SR- Yoga for Addiction and Recovery, Yoga Barre, Yin Yoga Restorative, Yoga Nidra, Ayurveda. She is also certified in group fitness AFFA and is a personal training
                            corrective exercise specialist (NASM, CPR-AED). </div>

                            Michigan, and an MBA in Marketing from the University of Pennsylvania’s Wharton School, Jen launched a successful career as a marketing professional in Manhattan. She began her yoga practice after her third knee surgery
                            at the age of 39. Originally there for the physical benefits, she soon realized that the philosophy behind the practice was helping her make peace with the negative body image issues she had struggled with since her teen
                            years. <br /><br /> Eager to share yoga’s benefits, Jen decided to train as a yoga teacher and received her 200-hour teacher certification from Ben Wisch at Flow Yoga in Ho-Ho-Kus, N.J., and opened her own studio, Defiant
                            Yoga, with the mission of helping individuals of all ages learn to love and accept themselves exactly as they are. She is proud to expand this mission as co-founder of Body Positive Works, an integrative healing and
                            wellness sanctuary located in Saddle River, NJ. <br /><br /> Jen has taken advanced trainings with Dr. Melody Moore of the Embody Love Movement, Leslie Kaminoff of Yoga Anatomy and Charlotte Stone of the Stone Center for
                            Yoga and Health. She is currently working on her 500 hour certification with Jody Domerstad of Become One Wholeness and so far has completed Neurosculpting®, Yin Yoga Level One, and Functional Anatomy. <br /><br /> Jen
                            was also instrumental in launching Kula for Karma’s Yoga for Eating Disorder Recovery program. She co-wrote the manual and teaches the Yoga for Recovery from Eating Disorders advanced teacher trainings. She is passionate
                            about this work and continues to teach Kula’s Yoga for Eating Disorders weekly at Body Positive Works. <br /><br /> In her yoga classes, Jen’s main priority is to help students hear their bodies’ signals and adjust the
                            practice to their unique needs in a welcoming, non-competitive space. Jen focuses on the purpose of the poses and how they feel rather than how they look. Students are encouraged to look at the language they use towards
                            their bodies (there is no such thing as a “bad” hip!) and to “stay on their own mats” (don’t compare!). Jen knows from personal experience that while embracing one’s body can be a challenging, lifelong journey, a regular
                            yoga practice reminds us that our bodies deserve to be treated with the utmost kindness, love and respect. </div>

                            years. She completed her 200-hr Teacher Training with the founder of Curvy Yoga, Anna Guest-Jelley (Nashville, TN) in 2013. <br /> <br /> Michelle came to yoga looking for an alternative to high-impact activity due to
                            injury and looking for a way to increase flexibility and strength safely. Living with body image issues her entire life, yoga became a tremendous tool on her road to body acceptance. Yoga provided the tools to allow her
                            to practice in a judgment –free zone and most importantly her mat became the safe space she needed to allow the mind-body connection she was missing. <br /> <br /> Michelle teaches options and customizations to work for
                            every body, in the here and now. Her yoga classes combine mindful movement and breath work that is accessible to all. </div>

                            and express myself better.” <br /> <br /> Alison is so thankful to have had the opportunity to study under some amazing yoga teachers including Sheryl Edsall, Jody Boisits and Eileen Alexander. Alison’s own yoga teacher
                            certifications include Hatha Yoga (200 hour), Yin Yoga, Neurosculpting, Functional Anatomy and Reiki. <br /> <br /> Alison approaches her yoga classes and her own practice with curiosity, reverence and compassion. Every
                            day is different, so she encourages her students to notice how they’re feeling that day, where they feel open and where they don’t and to find ways through breath and movement to feel more peace, clarity and lightness.
                            “Ultimately yoga helps us to slow down to get back in touch with what is really important to us.” <br /> <br /> Off the mat, Alison loves to spend time with family and friends, go for walks with her dog, read, eat good
                            food and enjoy funny movies. </div>
