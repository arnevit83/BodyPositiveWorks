        <h2>What is Massage?</h2> <br />
        <h4> 
          Massage is the manual manipulation of soft body tissue to restore balance, health and wellbeing to the body and mind.
          <br /><br />
          There are dozens of types of massage. Here are some of the most common types, which we offer at Body Positive Works.

        <h2>What is a Swedish Massage?</h2> <br />
        <h4> 
          Swedish massage is the most common form of therapeutic massage; a very relaxing and therapeutic type of bodywork.
          <br /><br />
          It combines oils or lotion with an array of strokes such as rolling, kneading, and percussion to help improve circulation, release tight muscles, and relieve pain. The massage therapist uses long gliding strokes to relax the entire body.

        <h2>What is a Deep Tissue Massage?</h2> <br />
        <h4> 
          A deep tissue massage uses many of the same techniques as a Swedish massage, but the massage therapist applies more pressure, so it feels stronger and goes deeper.
          <br /><br />
          It is often used to help heal specific injuries, restore range of motion, or get into an area that feels so tight it’s practically numb.

        <h2>What is Reflexology?</h2> <br />
        <h4> 
          Reflexology focuses on applying pressure to the specific nerve zones in your feet. Unlike other foot massages that relieve tension in the feet themselves, reflexology is a far more in-depth science that aims to harmonize your entire body. 
          <br /><br />
          According to reflexology, every part of the human body is mapped into your feet. A Reflexologist will work on specific points on the feet correlating to each organ, to promote healing in the corresponding organ.
          <br /><br />
          Reflexology has been found to be very effective for conditions such as allergies, headaches, and depression.

        <h2>What is a Prenatal Massage?</h2> <br />
        <h4> 
          A prenatal massage is similar to a full body massage, but the massage therapist will make modifications to ensure the comfort and safety of both mother and baby. 
          <br /><br />
          For example, the mother-to-be lies on her side and the abdomen is not massaged. The aim in pregnancy massage is relaxation and the soothing of the various aches and pains that accompany many pregnancies.

        <h2>Benefits of Massage</h2> <br />
        <h4> 
          The benefits of massage are wide-ranging and, besides a deep sense of relaxation and wellbeing, include reduced stress and anxiety, relief from aches and pains, enhanced mental clarity, glowing skin, and greater flexibility.
          <br /><br />
          “The issues are in our tissues” – so the saying goes. Physical pain, emotional pain, and mental pain are all stored in our body. Massage therapy uses healing human touch to help reduce this pain, releasing stored tension, anxiety and stress.
          <br /><br />
          Massage supports anyone wanting to balance mind and body, and supports those with mental health issues, emotional imbalance, and physical ailments.
          <br /><br />
          Massage can also be used as a tool to help regulate our mood – by stimulating a range of hormones. Dopamine – “the happy hormone,” Serotonin – “the calming hormone,” Endorphins – “the body’s natural pain reliever,” Cortisol – “the stress hormone,” and Adrenaline – “the fight/flight hormone.

        <h4> 
          
           
          We offer massage from our beautiful heritage house at the heart of Saddle River, Bergen County NJ. We are directly across the street from Wandell Elementary School, and next door to the Municipal Building. 
          <br /><br />
          We are centrally located with convenient access to Rt. 17 and the Garden State Parkway, and on the border of Rockland County. Check out how close you are to us on the map or use our drive time calculator from all localities – Westfield, Fair Lawn, Franklin Lakes, Glen Rock... Massage this good is well worth a short drive. Promise.
